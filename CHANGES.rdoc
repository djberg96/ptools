  issues in JRuby.

* Fixed some potential issues with File.tail. Thanks go to Matt Hoyle for
  the patch.

== 1.3.0 - 8-Dec-2014
* Made the File.tail method efficient. It's no longer slurpy, and it also no
  longer includes line endings in the result.
* Removed the File.middle method. I don't think it's useful.

* Thanks to Matt Hoyle for many of the changes implemented in this release.

== 1.2.6 - 14-Jul-2014
* Updated the png? and jpg? methods so they explicitly specify the
  offset argument so that it works with 1.9.2 and earlier. Thanks go to
  Anurag Priyam for the spot.

* Updated the tests for File.sparse? so that it doesn't rely on
  an external file.

== 1.2.4 - 25-Feb-2014
* The File.binary method now always returns false for images. It is meant to
  detect executables, shared objects, etc. Use File.image? to detect images.
* Encoding fixes for the File.image? method.

== 1.2.3 - 19-Feb-2014
* Fixed a bug where File.binary? would return true for unicode text. Thanks go
  to Ben Hollis for the spot.
* Updated the win32-file and test-unit dependencies.
* Replace all instances of File.exists? with File.exist? because the former
  is deprecated in Ruby 2.1 and later.

== 1.2.2 - 6-Apr-2012
* Yet another sparse file test fix for OSX, which does not support
  sparse file generation on HFS+.
* Fixed a bug in the File.whereis method on Windows when dealing with
  absolute paths.

  exists on Windows courtesy of the win32-file library.

* Refactored File.which and File.whereis and added additional tests for each.
* Removed the block form of File.whereis.

* Added cygwin and mingw to Windows detection code.
* One of the nlconvert tests is now skipped on Windows.
* Two text files that were previously bundled as part of this library for
  testing purposes have been removed. Those are now dynamically generated
  within the tests themselves.
* Gemspec updates.
* Documentation updates.
* Added the :gem rake task.

== 1.1.7 - 28-Jul-2009
* Now compatible with Ruby 1.9.x.

  rake install task.
* Updated the MANIFEST file, and made it rdoc friendly.
* Manual installation corrections in the README file.

== 1.1.3 - 29-Apr-2007
* I changed the way that the constants IS_WINDOWS and WIN32EXTS are defined.
* The IS_WINDOWS and WIN32EXTS are no long documented publically. They were
  never meant for public use.
* The tc_constants.rb file was modified to only run certain tests on Windows.

== 1.1.2 - 28-Apr-2007

* Added the File.binary? method, based on code from Ryan Davis.

== 1.1.0 - 23-Aug-2006
* Added the File.null method which returns the bit bucket on your platform.
* The suffixes on MS Windows are now based on the PATHEXT environment variable,
  and defaults to '.com', '.bat' and '.exe' only if it's not defined.
* The File.which and File.whereis methods were tweaked a bit for Windows so
  that they ignore the case of suffixes.
* Modified the platform checking and path separator handling.
* Added and tweaked some tests.

== 1.0.0 - 2-Jun-2005
* Modified the File.middle method to accept an optional block.
* File.whereis is now limited to unique values so that redundant PATH entries
  do not cause redundant entries in the returned array (or block).
* File.nl_convert and File.touch now return self.
* File.nl_convert now raises ArgumentError (instead of StandardError) if
  an unknown platform is provided.
* File.wc now raises ArgumentError (instead of RuntimeError) if a bad option
  is provided.
* Made documentation rdoc friendly.
* Test suite updates, corrections and additions.
* Removed the INSTALL file.  See the README instead.
* Moved project to RubyForge.

== 0.1.3 - 5-Dec-2003
* Modified File#which and File#whereis for Win32 to handle extensions better,
  i.e. you can send "ruby" or "ruby.exe" and get back the same result.
* Minor test changes to tc_which.rb and tc_whereis.rb.

== 0.1.2 - 14-May-2003
* Modified nl_convert() to allow the destination filename to be the same as the
  source file.  In that case, a tempfile is used and copied back over the
  original file.
* The target file name for nl_convert() now defaults to the source file name and
  the default format is now "dos".
